                        <article>
        <div>
            <p>I have a pretty loose rule in my house about books: when one comes in, one must go out. The book leaving may be one that’s out of date (I have owned a lot of Web-tech books over the years), one that I’ve read and didn’t need to keep as reference; or one that I’ve never read and realize I have no intention of reading.</p>

<p>The incoming books I’m quite excited about, but before I get to them, I needed to pick the outgoing books. Edward DeBono’s Teaching Thinking (buy it used on Amazon) has been on my shelf for a few years. I picked up my copy at a library book sale. It was (obviously) used. Parts of the text had been underlined in pen. Before tossing it in “to go” bin, I flipped through the book with the intention scanning every page to see if there were useful bits I could extract before moving on. I’m delighted I took the time to flip.</p>

<p>The book as a narrative from start to finish didn’t do much for me, but I scribbled a few pages worth of diagrams and notes. The section that caught my interest stated: All teaching is simply a matter of attention-directing. When conducted as activities in the class, all attention-directors are artificial. (I had a hard time processing that second part, but I came to realize this was artificial in the sense of “if I hadn’t artificially drawn the learner’s attention to this point, they wouldn’t have known to be aware of it”.</p>

<p>DeBono highlighted six methods for directing attention:</p>

<ul>
<li>North-South method. An external reference system to direct attention towards certain things. e.g. consequences, people.</li>
<li>Bird watching method. Spotting patterns and phenomenons. Used to identify different ways of being right, and wrong.</li>
<li>Apple boxing method. Sorting things into categories where the oblique intention of sorting will lead to close examination of the things themselves. Used to examine values and guesses.</li>
<li>Isolation method. Isolate certain obvious + automatic areas so they will get more attention. As at the “start” of thinking.</li>
<li>Framework method. Set up and use a checklist of attention areas which are set up ahead of the situation; each attention area/box is filled in turn from the situation.</li>
<li>Process model method. Directs attention to some basic process as distinct from areas. Setting up models of the process and applying them (analyze vs compare).</li>
</ul>

<p>After describing the methods, there was a reminder stating: Understanding alone does not lead to use. Use only comes from habit, and habit comes from practice.</p>

<p>It made me think of a recent training I’d conducted. The client had requested a lot of topics be covered. I knew there was no way the learners could gain any kind of mastery over the topics in such a short period of time. I knew I wanted to have more activities to cement at least a few of the core concepts. As I continue to refine my set curriculum I’ll now have a new lens to look at the content: I have a set of defined attention-directors that I can slide in as activities. None of them are particularly revolutionary, but I loved seeing the list of abstracted methods.</p>
