                <h1>The Speakers&#039; Checklist</h1>
                    <p>I use the following rough schedule when preparing for a conference presentation. Each 1-hour presentation could take up to 40 hours to prepare for. Workshops can take in the range of one week to prepare one day's worth of content. The efficiencies for workshops are because I've already dedicated some time to a workshop's topic before proposing it.</p>

<h2>3 Months</h2>

<ul>
<li>Write down the learning outcomes for the session. What do I want people to be able to <em>do</em> as a result of my talk?</li>
</ul>

<h2>2 Months</h2>

<ul>
<li>Choose the format for the presentation which best matches my desired learning outcomes.</li>
<li>Write a table of contents / agenda for the topic with the key ideas I want to convey.</li>
<li>Write the session description based on work to date. Ready to propose the topic to a meetup or event.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4-6 Weeks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Write a blog post; or series of blog posts about your talk. This acts as a transcript of what you might say and helps you to choose the important bits to talk about.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3 Weeks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Write the first draft of your slides, incorporating comments from the blog posts you've written.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2 Weeks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Start practicing your talk outloud.</li>
<li>Fix the slides to match your story, adding imagery where relevant.</li>
<li>Decrease the amount of text on each slide to just the key point you want to make for that idea.</li>
<li>Test your colours against common colour blindness problems; and for contrast. Various tools are available for different platforms. A quick Web search should help you to find something relevant, if not ask your friends. Statistic suggest you'll have at least one colour-blind friend.</li>
<li>Make sure you've included URLs (minified if necessary) to the blog posts you wrote earlier about your topic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1 Week</h2>

<ul>
<li>Screen cast your practice sessions until you can run through the presentation from start to finish without stopping to adjust any part of your presentation. This will be exceptionally difficult. </li>
<li>Your story should be final at this point. Practice for an audience if possible (e.g., your co-workers) wearing the outfit you plan to wear at the "real" presentation and with the approximate equipment you will be using at the event. This allows you to test things like: oh, you had a demo planned but the mic is hand held? That won't work. You were planning to wear a specific blouse, but the mic is clip on? That might not work.</li>
<li>Make sure your day bag easily fits your laptop, and day-of add-ons (remote control, VGA adapter, power converter). It's very stressful if you can't easily fit things into your day bag on the day of your presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3 Days</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do one more full run of your presentation.</li>
<li>Get a good night's sleep.</li>
<li>Reach out to your supporters to remind them of what time / room your presentation is, and explicitly ask them to attend if it's important to you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2 Days</h2>

<ul>
<li>Simplify your speaker notes so that they're easy to skim if you get muddled while you're on stage.</li>
<li>Get another good night's sleep.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Day Before</h2>

<ul>
<li>Go to the room where you'll be presenting. If you're able to, do a tech check to make sure </li>
<li>Drink lots of water and make sure you are hydrated. You probably won't sleep tonight. Don't stress about that. Do the best you can to relax.</li>
<li>Upload your slides if it's expected of you. Even if you've written really awesome blog posts, people will complain if they don't have the slides.</li>
<li>If you're an introvert, get as much quiet time as you can during the day to ensure you're fully charged for tomorrow.</li>
<li>Pack your bag for tomorrow and include your remote control, VGA adapter, and power cable (with relevant converter if you're not in your home country).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Game Day</h2>

<ul>
<li>Try to eat breakfast. Being stressed out takes calories.</li>
<li>Hydrate with water, or fruit juice. A dry throat goes hoarse quickly.</li>
<li>Check in with the conference organisers so they know you are on-site and ready to present.</li>
</ul>

<h2>One Hour Before</h2>

<ul>
<li>Another half glass of water.</li>
<li>Find the room you'll be presenting in and settle in at the back.</li>
<li>Get a sense for the lights and the contrast of the slides (you can request that the lights be turned up or down; I generally ask for the house lights to be turned up so I can see the audience...and I have very high contrast slides so that I can do this).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Half an Hour Before</h2>

<ul>
<li>Final pee! Introverts: this is our last time for piece and quiet and total aloneness before going on stage. It is probably also your last look in the mirror to make sure you don't have anything stuck between your teeth.</li>
<li>If the presentation ahead of you is still going, either wait outside the room, or sneak into the back quietly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>(Literally) The Last Few Minutes</h2>

<ul>
<li>As soon as you can, get onto the stage and graciously tell the folks on stage that they've done a great job. Then help them to shepherd people alway from the stage by saying you need to get setup. The previous presenter can answer questions in the hallway. Help them to see if they've forgotten anything on stage, and then help them to move on. You being rude to the audience is a LOT easier than the speaker doing it; you're helping them. (And hopefully someone will help shepherd you at the end of your talk.)</li>
<li>Get your laptop plugged in and working with the projector. If anything is going to go wrong, this is generally it.</li>
<li>Next, get help putting your mic on if it's a clip mic.</li>
<li>Open your slideshow software, bring up the first slide, and start the presentation. Make sure you can see your speaker notes (if note: your display is probably mirrored, you'll need to disable that).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you're set. I generally pace or use my friendly "I'm not available to chat yet" face so that the incoming audience knows to leave me alone. You might be more comfortable chatting with people than I am. I love to chat afterwards; but need the pre-talk time to centre myself.</p>
