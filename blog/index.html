 (September 19, 2015)

For over a decade I&#039;ve been teaching people how to use version control. My methods have changed over the years as I&#039;ve learned (first hand) what is most effective for different types of learners, and under different conditions. I spent a year packing all of that thinking and learning into...

Some topics I play with for years. Turning them over, coming at them from different angles, in different formats, and presenting the information to different people. I enjoy finding better ways to help people through topics I&#039;ve tackled myself. Last week I gave two presentations based on the book I&#039;m...

Although this site hasn&#039;t been getting a lot of attention in the last few months, I&#039;ve been hard at work on various Git resources.

 (June 28, 2014)
</dt>

This resource talks about git&#039;s optimization for the patching work 
flow, but how &quot;modern&quot; work flows are optimized for the
forking/branching work flow.  The problem is that these more &quot;social&quot;
work flows often have a commit granularity that is not compatible 
with git&#039;s tools (e.g. bisect). As we shift away from...

 (June 17, 2014)

It&#039;s a classic mistake for a teacher to walk you through the
process of how they arrived at an answer when teaching you how
to think about a problem. In my most recent resource on commit
granularity, I&#039;ve done exactly 
this. Fortunately the ideas are still running around in my head, so 
I...

While working on a resources page for commit best practices, I
ended up in an interesting
conversation with Scott Murray and Camille Fournier on the review process. Scott asked the question, &quot;How can I ensure a contribution is good before I click &#039;merge&#039;?&quot;

What a great question! How subjective! How arbitrary! How do...

As I prepare for the OSCON workshop, Git for Teams of One or
More, I&#039;ve been collecting resources over on bit.ly. Unfortunately bit.ly doesn&#039;t seem to have a way to organize a bundle of links into categories. The resources I added more-or-less fall into the following categories:

This web site is designed to support learners who wish to use
version control in a more efficient manner. The original
version of the site was created for an online workshop that I
taught. Subsequently, it has become a holding place for
resources relating to the in-person workshops that I&#039;ve taught
(and perhaps will teach...
