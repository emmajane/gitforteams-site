            <p>As I prepare for the OSCON workshop, <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/user/proposal/status/34208">Git for Teams of One or
More</a>, I've been collecting resources over on <a href="https://bitly.com/bundles/o_5qda61i6ae/2">bit.ly</a>. Unfortunately bit.ly doesn't seem to have a way to organize a bundle of links into categories. The <a href="/resources/offsite.html">resources I added</a> more-or-less fall into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mega learning resources</li>
<li>Cheat sheets and quick references</li>
<li>Workflow - 10,000ft view</li>
<li>Workflow - applied</li>
<li>Merge vs. Rebase Workflow</li>
<li>Team Governance</li>
<li>Commit Messsages - standards and granularity</li>
<li>Visualizing Git</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this is a topic I've been teaching for years, I still
take the time to re-evaluate the structure of the material each
time I teach the topic. The most recent iteration worked well
for managers, but it lacked some of the hands-on examples which
developers might have benefited from (the one-hour session
didn't give room for both).</p>

<p>As I continue to read how others have presented the
information, I continue to see the strengths (and weaknesses)
of how we teach workflow and source control. Two of the
articles on the size of a commit were especially interesting in
thinking about source control from the perspective of "teams of
one or more". The first article outlines the importance of a
<a href="https://sandofsky.com/blog/git-workflow.html">clean history which is easy to inspect and
analyze</a>. The
second article talks about some of the tools that are used,
such as git bisect, when <a href="https://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/git-best-practices-workflow-guidelines">identifying where a problem was introduced</a>.</p>

<p>I think this distinction is interesting because (again, my opinion here) a very tiny team is more likely to identify a bug and move forward to fix
the bug; but a larger team, with more senior developers, is more likely to investigate how /
why a regression was introduced. (Have I mentioned this is purely
speculation on my part?) Is this also the difference between a
project which is using tests / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test driven
development</a> vs. one that is not ("test later" / cowboy coding)? Or perhaps the difference between a team which is motiviated by Lean best practices and is motivated to uncover and fix the root problem by <a href="http://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/cause-effect/determine-root-cause-5-whys/">asking the question why</a>.</p>

<p>And so, at the end of all of my reading and thinking today, I'm
leaving myself with the question: how do we balance between
ease-of-use now and tools to help future me debug a project?
It sort of reminds me of a comment made in a devops
presentation: if you aren't going to use the logs to improve
your efficiencies, why are you bothering to track the
information in the first place. Indeed, it's a delicate balance
and one where the solution becomes more obvious with experience.</p>
