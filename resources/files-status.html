<h1>Status Report: Monitor Files Easily</h1>

  <div>
    <p>Everyone has their own frustrations around working with Git.
Maybe yours are super advanced frustrations, or maybe they're
really basic. @mickymetts recently told me about this
frustration: "the little part of - WHERE ARE MY FREAKIN FILES
NOW? When are they local, and merging, and branching ..." I
have a lot of respect for folks who feel the need to use all
caps when gettin' angry at Git. This is a sign of someone who's
still fighting, still trying to learn and who's not given up
yet. If you're still in all caps mode, you still care, and
if you care, it's because you're still trying to figure things out.</p>

<p>Note: I would like to add more to this resource which will include
how to find the status of specific <em>files</em>; however, these few
tips should be considered part of your essential git toolkit
and might just be enough to get you started down a smoother
path.</p>

<h2 id="customize-your-command-prompt">Customize Your Command Prompt</h2>

<p>If you're working from the command line, you get ZERO clues
about what's going on with your files, until you explicitly ask
Git about them. This is tedious to keep having to ask. It's
like when you were 8 and sat in the back of the car whining at
the driver saying, "are we almost there yet?"</p>

<p>Instead of having to explicitly ask, I've modified my command line 
prompt to tell me which branch I currently have checked out and 
whether or not I've made changes to any of the files in my 
repository. This is a fairly common hack, but every developer
will have their own little quirks on how they implement it.
Searching the web for <code>bash prompt git status</code> will yield lots
of results. My own prompt is fairly simple, but others have
added a lot more details to their prompt. For example: <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/pn8f0g">Show your git status and branch (in color) at the command prompt</a> or <a href="https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt">local
file status</a>. As
with all things technical: the more you add initially, the more
you'll need to debug if it doesn't work right away.</p>

<p>I found the fancy prompts to actually be quite fussy to set up,
and ended up giving up on the really detailed ones. I recommend
you too start with something really simple and then add to it if
you <em>really</em> need more information. The simple change in
colour, along with the name of the branch, actually suits me
just fine and is less distracting without all the extra
information.</p>

<h2 id="check-the-status-of-your-files">Check the Status of Your Files</h2>

<p>Once you've got some kind of indication about the status of
your files, you can start asking git for specifics. Assuming
you've already adjusted your prompt, you should now get some
kind of visual indicator when the branch you're working on is
"dirty". This is git slang for "has work which has not been
committed to the local repository". To check which files have
uncommitted changes, run the command:</p>

<p><code>git status</code></p>

<p>Within the output, you'll find information about the
corresponding remote branch, untracked files, and tracked files
with changes. Here's an example from this page before the file
was added to the local repository:</p>

<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

  files-status.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</code></pre>

<p>The second line can be a bit misleading. It currently states
that the branch is up-to-date with the remote repository...but
it's only showing you the status as of <em>the last time I checked</em> the 
remote repository. Unlike Twitter and Facebook, command line
git is not running in the background collecting status updates
from your friends and co-workers.</p>

<h2 id="update-your-status-updates">Update Your Status Updates</h2>

<p>To check if there are any changes on the server for the branch you're
working on, you'll need to <code>fetch</code> the status of the remote
repository:</p>

<p><code>git fetch origin</code></p>

<p>Assuming everything is up-to-date, you'll get no message back.
If there have been new commits in the remote repository, you'll
get a message as git downloads the new commits. The Atlassian
tutorial on remote repositories does an okay job of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/remote-repositories#!fetch">explaining
git
fetch</a>. 
The article also shows you how to review the new changes you've just 
downloaded. If you have multiple projects you're working on, you 
might find <a href="https://github.com/genehack/app-gitgot">GitGot</a> useful. 
This little app makes it easier to bulk manage all of your local git 
repositories from the command line.</p>

<h2 id="use-a-branch-aware-log-browser">Use a Branch-Aware Log Browser</h2>

<p>Finally, the last little tool I find helpful, is some kind of
graph generator for my repository's history. This tool gives me
the context of where a change came "from" (are you a branch? is
it ahead of another branch in terms of commits?). GUIs for git
will give you a much more elegant view of your repository than
these tools, but they work just fine for me.</p>

<p>I can either draw the graph at the command line:</p>

<p><code>git log --oneline --graph</code></p>

<p>An example of this output would be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>* edcd486 Updated deps.
* 05af892 No need for layout anymore.
*   eb85b12 Merge pull request #11 from stevector/master--implements-spelling
|\
| * 086b01e Spelling fix in 2013-02-04-highlight.md
* |   c5f46bd Merge pull request #10 from stevector/master--fixing-typo-in-readme
|\ \
| * | 58e67f4 Spelling fix in README
|/ /
* |   eebb37d Merge pull request #8 from kenjis/fix_url
</code></pre>

<p>The dots represent a commit. Anything to the right of the first
is (or was) a branch. The branch names are not listed in this
output.</p>

<p>Or, I can open up the git browser, gitk, and click around a bit. The
git browser is a special add-on which might not be enabled in
your version of git. For example: this functionality is <em>not</em>
available in the OSX-installed version of git, but it is
available in the brew-installed version. To open the browser,
use the following command:</p>

<p><code>gitk</code></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>If you're working from the command line, it can be a bit of a
hassle to find the current status for all of your files.</p>

<ol>
<li>Update your prompt to include a git status notification.</li>
<li>Remember to fetch changes from your remote repository
regularly.</li>
<li>Use a log browser to give you more context of how your
branch is doing compared to others.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you've got more specific questions on how to see the status
of a file, ping me on twitter (@emmajanehw), and I'll add them
to this resource!</p>
