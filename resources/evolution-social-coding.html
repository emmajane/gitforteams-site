<h1>The Evolution of Social Coding with Git</h1>

  <div>
    <p>This is a rough set of ideas about how open source software has
changed in the last decade or so, and how it's affected our ability
to work with the tools Git provides. It's not based on solid
research or anything useful like that. Just complete and total
speculation on my part. Feel free to flip tables, disagree at me on
Twitter (@emmajanehw), and write your own response piece about how
wrong I am.</p>

<h2 id="from-patching-work-flow-to-social-coding">From Patching Work Flow to Social Coding</h2>

<p>When I first started contributing to open source projects (a
little over a decade ago) there were two things I needed to
learn when it came to version control: CVS, and reading a patch
file which was attached to an email. Most of the projects I
worked on used CVS, and as a result I taught my students how to
use CVS as well. Most of the open source projects I followed,
however, used a "patching" work flow. Indeed, Drupal still
works this way.</p>

<p>As a result of the patching work flow, I became very
comfortable reading diff files (and as a result, patches). It
wasn't a lot of fun, but it was tedious work. (If you're not at
all familiar with these tools, you can peek at <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/introduction-using-diff-and-patch/">Introduction to
Using Diff and
Patch</a>
for a decent overview of what was involved.) There are even
<a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/">tracking systems</a> 
designed to work in conjunction with mailing list to capture patches 
sent to a mailing list and publish them to a web interface.</p>

<p>In this work flow, it makes the most sense to submit your idea
when you think you're close to a solution (or perhaps you're
stuck and need help). The granularity of what you submit would
not include the micro steps you took to get to this point;
rather, it would simply include the completed changes you made
against the original version of the files you were working
from. To support this work flow, there is even a git command,
<code>am</code> which splits email messages in a given mailbox into a
commit message, authorship information, and the patch file
itself. (You can <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-am.html">read the man
page</a> 
for the command to get a better sense of the types of information it 
can process.) Indeed the creator of Git, Linus Torvalds, is
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5654674">notoriously picky about his commit
messages</a>.</p>

<p>Some modern projects still use a patching work flow. Yes,
dealing with patches is still tedious work as the patches need
to be kept up-to-date by re-creating the files. (There is <a href="https://www.drupal.org/patch/reroll">a
very long guide</a> on how to do 
this. Skim it to see how annoying this process is; don't worry if 
you don't understand all the steps involved as it's not
important for this particular rant.) By using a patching work
flow, however, the developers are still working with whole ideas 
when they apply changes to their software.</p>

<p>If we take a look at Git itself, many of the tools it gives us
are optimized for dealing with whole ideas, and also creating
whole ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html">Bisect</a>: 
A binary search of past commits which allows you to 
determine when a bug was introduced. Git temporarily reverts
your code by individual commits and allows you to mark a
commit as "good" or "bad". To be effective, every commit
you're testing needs to have a working version of your code.
If, for example, you have a commit which is "stopped working
for the night" and the code is not actually in a functional
state, you end up wasting time finding the <em>useful</em> commits
where the code did actually work. A great example of <a href="http://webchick.net/node/99">how <code>bisect</code>
works in practice is available here</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rebase.html">Rebase</a>:
Apply commits to a branch as if they happened in a different
order than what the history suggests. This feature also
allows you to combine (or separate) individual commits. By
combining (or "squashing") multiple commits into one, you can
come closer to the idea of a "whole idea" which I discussed
previously. Rebasing is essentially re-drawing the graph of
how a history of commits was performed. (Conceptually I hate
rebasing. It feels like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionist_history">revisionist
history</a>. I
also understand why it is a necessary tool and do use it when
it is appropriate to do so.)</li>
</ul>

<p>So we have these two concepts that are optimized for working
with whole ideas. If we look at social coding today though, the
experience is actually optimized on the <strong>conversation</strong> it
takes to get to a whole idea. If you take a look at the <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow">GitHub
Flow Guide</a> you
can see that the experience is optimized for a conversation
including micro adjustments of code along the way. At the end
of the conversation the branch where the conversation took
place is merged into the main branch. This leaves a commit
record which represents the development of the conversation.
For all kinds of reasons, I think the history of the
development of an idea is fascinating. I support this work
flow.</p>

<p>Contrast this conversation-driven work flow to the patching
work flow I described initially. In the patching work flow,
only whole ideas (or the final patch) are committed to the
master branch. The thinking process is not included in the
commit history (although it might be included in the commit
message).</p>

<p>Why does this matter? It matters because Git is optimized to
work with individual commits.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-whole-ideas">Working With Whole Ideas</h2>

<p>Compare the graphical log for Git and another distributed
version control project, Bazaar. By default Bazaar shows only
the final commit from a given branch. You need to click the
branch to see the commits (or the conversation) which happened
along the way.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/bzr-log-graphical.png" alt="bazaar explorer shows branches collapsed by
default" /></p>

<p>In other words: the way Bazaar displays its commit history is 
optimized for the forking (and branching) work flows that GitHub and 
other social coding platforms promote. (Don't worry, this isn't
going to turn into a Bazaar is Better Than Git article. I just
wanted you to see an alternative way of perceiving the
information.)</p>

<p>To contrast this, take a look at how Git displays commit
history. Instead of showing groups of ideas,  Git shows the 
individual commits along the entire length of a branch.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/git-log-graphical.png" alt="gitk and git log --graph output
focus on individual commits" /></p>

<p>Not only that, but look at those useless default commit
messages in Git where a merged happened ("Merge pull request
issue_number from username/branchname"). It doesn't tell me
anything about what the branch was about! For that I have to go
back and read the commit messages in every commit up to that
point. Beginning from the first commit for the branch where the
idea was first introduced. If you're the person trying to
understand <em>why</em> a branch was merged in by using the
information stored in Git, good luck to you! Typically the best
way to obtain that information is now the external ticketing
system, not the code repository itself.</p>

<p>Once you understand how Git was used by its original creators, and 
for what experience it has optimized itself, you are left with
two options: adopt a ticketing system and use its built-in features 
to track your changes to the code base over time; or insist
your team adopt a rebasing work flow and attempt to re-create the 
patching work flow which presents whole ideas, not conversations, in 
the commit history. If you choose the first option, you are
essentially throwing out any future hope of using Git's built-in 
tools to do anything useful with your commit history. You are
also, essentially, committing yourself to vendor lock-in for
your ticketing system because the legible version of history
will be captured in the ticket system, not in the commit
messages themselves.</p>

<p>Over time this will allow (or force?) Git to stagnate as a
product, increasing our dependence on individual (often
proprietary) systems to hold our institutional / code history.
This is scary because these systems tend to be built around
companies, and sometimes companies don't last forever.</p>

<p>Woah. That was kind of alarmist, wasn't it.</p>

<h2 id="making-git-social">Making Git Social</h2>

<p>So where do we go from here? We begin, ironically, with a
conversation about what's important to us. I don't have
any perfect answers for you, but hopefully I have some
thought-provoking ideas.</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine, with your team, if it is more important to have
an easy-to-use set of Git commands to allow the widest
possible group of people to participate; or if it is more
important to be able to move your project to a new code
hosting platform if your current one disappears tomorrow.
If ease-of-use trumps portability, by all means continue to
work in whatever commit granularity is easiest for the
contributor. But if it's more important to be able to
migrate the history of your code to a new platform, consider
adopting (and enforcing) a rebasing culture where each
commit is as close as possible to a whole idea.</li>
<li>If it's important to you that we continue to make coding
social, and if ease-of-participation is important, consider the
limitations of the defacto source control system we use. Git
is open source.  There are loads of fantastic graphical
interfaces which have been built on top of Git, but they're
all still limited to the same original concept that a commit
is a whole idea. I've spent time looking, but I haven't
found tools which do a great job of visualizing the whole
ideas of a branch. We can, and should, build better tools
which allow us to track changes to our code in a "modern"
fashion and without having to rely on third-party systems.</li>
<li>Currently, the default commit message for a merge sucks if
you're using a social coding work flow (branching or forking
as opposed to patching). There's no reason why we can't make
Git better at dealing with how we want to work with it.
I don't know what the default message for a merge should be.
A duplicate of the last commit message in the branch that's
being merged (potential problem: what about a three-way
merge)? Maybe you like the final commit message as is and it
works for your team...or maybe you've never even really
thought about it because you have a GUI which sits on top of
Git.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm sure there are other questions as well. But this is where
I'm at right now. I don't really mean to seem like an alarmist.
I just think it's an interesting pickle that we've gotten
ourselves into. The way we code has become very social. It's
centred around conversations and in many cases it's based
around a Web interface. I don't necessarily think that's a bad
thing, but I'm old enough to remember when SourceForge was
still cool (sorry SourceForge!). I remember seeing the wave of
projects move towards self-hosting and now the wave back to a
centralized system. I think we're losing the benefits of a
distributed version control system by becoming so attached to our
centralized systems; but I think we're there because Git is so
damned opaque. ("Git is easy to learn! It's just a directed
acyclic graph of your commits!" Seriously? <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/git-for-grownups/">Fuck
that</a>.)</p>

<p>I want us to do better. We need to do better. And if we can't
do better, I at least want it to be a conscious choice to have
limited ourselves to the participation models that were created
in 2005 by a kernel developer whose relationship with a
proprietary software product went sour and whose community license 
was revoked. When you think about it, you know that we
absolutely must do better and that we cannot allow ourselves to be
complacent when it comes to our livelihoods and participation in the
Web development, and open source software communities. It's
really just a question of where we need to start so that we can
fix the pickle we seem to have gotten ourselves into.</p>
